-------------------
QUESTIONS: 
{'learning_standard': 'CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.4.5 : Describe the overall structure (e.g., chronology, comparison, cause/effect, problem/solution) of events, ideas, concepts, or information in a text or part of a text.', 'introduction': "Today, we're going to explore the life cycle of a butterfly! We'll be examining the way information is organized in a text and the sequence of events that occur in the life cycle of this fascinating creature. Keep in mind, our goal is to understand how the author structured the information about the butterfly's life cycle.", 'questions': [{'id': 1, 'question': "Can you identify and describe the overall structure of the text about the butterfly's life cycle? Is it arranged in a chronological order, comparison, cause/effect, or problem/solution manner?"}, {'id': 2, 'question': "How does the author transition from one stage of the butterfly's life cycle to the next? Does this structure make it easier to understand the changes that occur throughout the butterfly's life?"}, {'id': 3, 'question': 'If you were to explain the life cycle of a butterfly to a friend, how would you structure the information? Would you choose the same structure as the author of our text, or would you present it differently?'}]}
-------------------
ANSWER QUESTIONS: 
[{'id': 1, 'answer': "The text about the butterfly's life cycle is in chronological order. It starts with the egg, then the caterpillar, then the chrysalis, and lastly the butterfly.", 'grade': 5}, {'id': 2, 'answer': "The author uses words like 'then' and 'next' to move from one stage to another. I think it helps because it shows the order of how things happen.", 'grade': 4}, {'id': 3, 'answer': "I would tell it the same way because it's easy to understand. But maybe I would also draw a picture to show it clearer.", 'grade': 3}, {'finalGrade': 4}]

EVALUATIONS: 
{'evaluations': [{'id': 1, 'grade': 5, 'explanation': "Excellent job! You correctly identified the text's structure as chronological order. You also clearly described the sequence of the butterfly's life cycle, showing a good understanding of the topic. Keep up the good work!"}, {'id': 2, 'grade': 4, 'explanation': "Good job! You correctly identified how the author uses transitional words like 'then' and 'next' to move from one stage of the life cycle to the next. It would have been even better if you could provide specific examples from the text. Keep practicing your reading skills!"}, {'id': 3, 'grade': 4, 'explanation': "Good job! I like that you would stick to the chronological structure because it's easy to understand. Your idea to draw a picture to make it clearer is also great. It would be helpful if you could explain why you think the picture would help in understanding the life cycle better. Keep up the creativity!"}], 'finalGrade': 4.3, 'finalFeedback': "Great job overall! You showed a good understanding of the text structure and the butterfly's life cycle. You were also creative in your approach to explaining the life cycle to a friend. Remember to provide more detailed explanations and specific examples from the text in your answers. Keep up the good work and continue practicing your reading skills!"}
