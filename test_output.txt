QUESTIONS: 
{'learning_standard': 'CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.7.5 : Analyze how a drama’s or poem’s form or structure contributes to its meaning', 'introduction': "Welcome to this exploration of Greek Mythology! We will be delving into fascinating tales of gods, goddesses, and mythical creatures, and analyzing how the structure of these stories helps in conveying their meanings. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers - just your unique interpretations. Let's get started!", 'questions': [{'id': 1, 'question': 'Choose a Greek myth and describe its structure. How does this structure contribute to the overall meaning of the story?'}, {'id': 2, 'question': "Think about the myth of Pandora's Box. How does the sequence of events add to its meaning and impact?"}, {'id': 3, 'question': "Consider the myth of Icarus. How does the structure of the myth - his ambition, his father's warning, his fall - contribute to the moral of the story?"}, {'id': 4, 'question': "How does the structure of the myth of Persephone's abduction by Hades help to explain the change of seasons?"}]}
-------------------
ANSWER QUESTIONS: 
[{'id': 1, 'answer': "The Greek myth I picked is Zeus and his lightning bolt. Zeus's lightning bolt is strong and that's the story.", 'grade': 1}, {'id': 2, 'answer': "In the Pandora's Box myth, first Pandora gets the box but told not to open it. Then she opens it and all the bad stuff comes out. It shows curiosity can lead to bad things.", 'grade': 3}, {'id': 3, 'answer': "The story of Icarus is structured in a way that shows the consequences of not listening to advice. Icarus was warned by his father not to fly too close to the sun, but he didn't listen. As a result, the wax on his wings melted and he fell into the sea. This structure emphasizes the moral of the story, which is the danger of overconfidence and disobedience.", 'grade': 5}, {'id': 4, 'answer': "The story of Persephone's abduction by Hades is structured in a way that explains the change of seasons. Persephone has to spend part of the year in the underworld because she ate pomegranate seeds there, which is like winter when she's gone. When she comes back to her mother Demeter, it's like spring and summer because Demeter is happy and everything grows again. So, the structure of the story helps explain why we have different seasons.", 'grade': 4}, {'finalGrade': 3.25}]

EVALUATIONS: 
{'evaluations': [{'id': 1, 'grade': 2, 'explanation': "Your answer needs improvement. You have chosen the myth of Zeus and his lightning bolt, which is fine, but you didn't describe its structure or explain how the structure contributes to the overall meaning of the story. Try to think about the sequence of events in the story and how they build up to the main point or moral of the myth. Then, explain how this structure helps to convey that point or moral."}, {'id': 2, 'grade': 3, 'explanation': "Your answer is satisfactory. You identified the sequence of events in the Pandora's Box myth and mentioned how it conveys the idea that curiosity can lead to bad things. However, try to explain more about how the sequence of events builds up to this message. For example, you could talk about the suspense created when Pandora is told not to open the box, and the release of this suspense when she disobeys and unleashes evils into the world."}, {'id': 3, 'grade': 4, 'explanation': "Good job! You clearly explained the structure of the Icarus myth and connected it to the moral of the story. You could improve your answer by going into a bit more detail about how each part of the structure - Icarus's ambition, his father's warning, and his fall - contributes to the moral."}, {'id': 4, 'grade': 5, 'explanation': 'Excellent work! You provided a clear and detailed description of the structure of the Persephone myth and explained how it explains the change of seasons. Your answer shows a deep understanding of how the structure of a story can contribute to its meaning.'}], 'finalGrade': 3.5, 'finalFeedback': 'Overall, you have a good understanding of how the structure of a story contributes to its meaning, as seen in your answers to questions 3 and 4. However, you need to apply this understanding more consistently, as seen in your answer to question 1. Keep practicing, and remember to always think about how the sequence of events in a story builds up to its main point or moral. Keep up the good work!'}
